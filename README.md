- 👋 Hi, I’m @foxy-gal
- 👀 I’m interested in system analysis, software development, architecture, ML. Besides, I luv snowboarding&skiing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, linux, maths, ML at Ural Federal University. So I am making learning projects for practice and just for fun. So I am going to save some of them here.  
- 💞️ I'm not looking to collaborate on right now, except with my classmates from the university.
- 📫 Feel free to contact me by email or direct messages if u want to.
